How to communicate with LLMs effectively(Prompting)? 

Let's first understand various prompting methods.


##1) Single-shot and multi-shot or few-shot prompting are fundamental techniques in prompt engineering that refer to the number of examples provided to an AI model to guide its behavior. Few-shot learning can often improve model performance, especially when the task is difficult or when we want the model to respond in a specific manner.  
eg:
Single-shot example.

"""
Translate this sentence to French:
English: "Hello, how are you?"
French: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"
Now translate: "I love reading books."
"""
Few-shot example.
"""
Translate these sentences into French:
English: "Hello, how are you?"
French: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"

English: "What time is it?"
French: "Quelle heure est-il?"

English: "I'm going to the store."
French: "Je vais au magasin."

Now translate: "I love reading books."

2) Chain of thought prompting.
A powerful technique that gets LLMs to show their reasoning process step by step. Research shows that CoT prompting enables LLMs to perform better at reasoning tasks when they are encouraged to write down intermediate reasoning steps.

eg:

"""A train leaves Chicago at 2 PM traveling 60 mph. Another leaves New York at 3 PM traveling 80 mph. The cities are 800 miles apart. When do they meet?."""

Think carefully through each step: ###[ here, think carefully at each step, it significantly improves the performance even when queries are complex. ]###


1. Identify what we know

2. Determine what we need to find

3. Choose the appropriate method

4. Work through the calculation

5. Verify the answer makes sense

3) Prompting using XML tags.
It is especially useful in scenarios requiring structured input/output, such as generating formatted text, extracting specific information, or guiding complex tasks.
eg.
Structured Instructions

Â    <instruction>Write a summary of the following text in 100 words or fewer.</instruction>
    **<text>** Input text here .....**</text>**

2. Data Extraction
<task>Extract the name and email from the following:</task>
<data>John Doe, john.doe@example.com, 123-456-7890</data>
<output_format>
<name></name>
<email></email>
</output_format>
3. Multi-step complex tasks.
<step1>Analyze the sentiment of this text.</step1>
<step2>Based on the sentiment, write a response.</step2>
<text>The product was amazing!</text>

4) Role-Based Prompting

Role-based prompting is a technique where you assign a specific role, persona, or identity to an AI model to guide its responses and behavior. By establishing a clear role at the beginning of your conversation, you can get more targeted, consistent, and contextually appropriate responses.
